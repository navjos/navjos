- 👋 Hi, I’m Josselyn! Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile. This place is a mosaic of small projects I have recently taken on to rebuild my software development skills.
    I currently work for a property tech startup. Previously, I was an equities trader at Goldman Sachs for 2 years. 
- 👀 I’m interested in fintech, real estate, latin dance, and product development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently growing my front-end and back-end development skills. I am working towards the IBM full stack developer certificate. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on creative ways to help underbanked communities achieve financial independence, create generational wealth, and make financial literacy more inclusive. 
- 📫 You can reach me via joss.navas09@gmail.com.
