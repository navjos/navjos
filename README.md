- 👋 Hi, I’m Josselyn! Thanks for visiting my GitHub profile. This place is a mosaic of small projects I have recently taken on to rebuild my software development skills.

- 👀 I’m interested in fintech, financial literacy, Latin Dance, and app-development. 
- 🌱 I’m currently (re)learning how to build apps! 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on finding new ways we can help underbanked communities achieve financial independence.
